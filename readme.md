============

This is sample VS Extension project for Visual Studio 2019 and is part of larger
undisclosed project that I am working on and basically, I have issue with Visual
Studio 2019 Extension coming with larger window. In this example, it basically
the demonstrated ToolWindow with 800x600 change and some attempts to modified
based on suggestions from StackOverflow

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62577855/desire-specific-size-of-visual-studio-2019-extension-toolwindow-wpf-usercontro>

Please update project or indicated what the issue is. I completely understand
that if user changes the size it Visual Studio will persist the size â€“ my
concern is Visual Studio 2019 ( only one I am concern with ) does not set it to
correct size on default.
